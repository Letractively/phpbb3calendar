### phpbb3 Calendar ###

This project is a MOD for the phpbb3 web forum solution. It adds an event calendar that can be customized for all user needs. Users can add events and then easy view them, in day or month views. The Permissions are very easily integrated into the phpbb3 core code so the user does not have to be code savvy.
